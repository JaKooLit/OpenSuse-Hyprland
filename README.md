## ü™ßü™ßü™ß ANNOUNCEMENT ü™ßü™ßü™ß

- Check out changelogs here [`Hyprland-Dots-Changelogs`](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Hyprland-Dots/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) 

### üÜï  Prerequisites
- This install script is intended for Tumbleweed (Generic Desktop). On my test, the "server type" gives lots of errors.
- In theory, This should work on a any Tumbleweed with DE (Plasma, Gnome, XFCE). Although I am not sure about xfce default login manager if able to detect Hyprland.

### ‚ú®  Some notes on installation
- Some apps are being installed using OPI. These packages are wlogout, swaylock-effects and nwg-look

### ‚ú® Costumize the packages
- inside the install-scripts folder, you can edit 00-hypr-pkgs.sh, etc. Care though as the Hyprland Dots might not work properly
- default GTK theme if agreed to be installed is Tokyo night GTK themes (dark and light) + Tokyo night SE icons

### ‚ùó some known issues
- reports from members of my discord, states that some users of nvidia are getting stuck on sddm login. credit  to @Kenni Fix stated was 
```  
 while in sddm press ctrl+alt+F2 or F3
log into your account
`lspci -nn`, find the id of your nvidia card
`ls /dev/dri/by-path` find the matching id
`ls -l /dev/dri/by-path` to check where the symlink points to 
)
7. add "env = WLR_DRM_DEVICES,/dev/dri/cardX" to the ENVvariables config (.config/hypr/configs/ENVariables.conf)  ; X being where the symlink of the gpu points to
```
