### 🪧🪧🪧 ANNOUNCEMENT 🪧🪧🪧
- This Repo does not contain Hyprland Dots or configs! Dotfiles can be checked here [`Hyprland-Dots`](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Hyprland-Dots) . During installation, if you opt to copy pre-configured dots, it will be downloaded from that centralized repo.
- Hyprland-Dots use are constantly evolving / improving. you can check CHANGELOGS here [`Hyprland-Dots-Changelogs`](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Hyprland-Dots/wiki/Changelogs)
- Since the Hyprland-Dots are evolving, some of the screenshots maybe old
- the wallpaper offered to be downloaded towards the end is from this [`REPO`](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Wallpaper-Bank)

### ♨️ Activating Packman Repo
- by default, the packman mirror chosen is "https://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/misc/packman/suse/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/"
- if you require to change the mirror, edit install-scripts/00-packman.sh and add mirrors of your choice. you can find mirrors [HERE](http://packman.links2linux.org/mirrors)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> install a backup tool like `snapper` or `timeshift`. and Backup your system before installing hyprland using this script. This script does NOT include uninstallation of packages

> [!NOTE]
> Main reason why I have not included an uninstallation script is simple. Some packages maybe already installed on your system by default. If I create an uninstall script with packages that I have set to install, you may end up a unrecoverable system. 

> [!CAUTION]
> Download this script on a directory where you have write permissions. ie. HOME. Or any directory within your home directory. Else script will fail

#### 🆕  Prerequisites
- This install script is intended for atleast Server type installed.
- In theory, This should work on a any Tumbleweed with DE (Plasma, Gnome, XFCE). Although I am not sure about xfce default login manager if able to detect Hyprland.
- If you have nvidia, and wanted to use proprietary drivers, uninstall nouveau first (if installed). This script will be installing proprietary nvidia drivers and will not deal with removal of nouveau.

#### ✨  Some notes on installation
- Some apps are being installed using OPI. These packages are wlogout, swaylock-effects and nwg-look
- for SDDM, by script sddm-qt6 will be installed. If you have already sddm, I HIGHLY SUGGEST NOT to install sddm through this script since I dont know the impact to your current sddm. Opensuse ship 2 version, sddm and sddm-qt6. The latter is more up to date... (I think)
- Another for SDDM, if you are installing from a server type of opensuse install, I highly suggest to install the sddm theme since you'll get a vanilla look sddm theme. 

#### ✨ Costumize the packages
- inside the install-scripts directory, you can edit 02-hypr-pkgs.sh, etc. Care though as the Hyprland Dots might not work properly

#### 💫 SDDM and GTK Themes offered
- If you opted to install SDDM theme, here's the [`LINK`](https://github.com/JaKooLit/simple-sddm-2)
- If you opted to install GTK Themes, Icons here's the [`LINK`](https://github.com/JaKooLit/GTK-themes-icons) & Bibata Cursor Modern Ice (assets directory)

#### ⚠️ WARNING! If you have GDM already as log-in manager, DO NOT install SDDM
- You will likely to encounter issues

#### 🔔 NOTICE TO NVIDIA OWNERS ### 
- Please take note that the nvidia driver will be install is G06 driver, which is for GeForce 700 series (Maxwell, Pascal...) and up see here [`NVIDIA-Opensuse-Link`](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:NVIDIA_drivers)
- You can edit the install-scripts/nvidia.sh if you require for older cards. However, do take note that it may not work as older nvidia drivers dont support wayland well.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to use nouveau driver, choose N when asked if you have nvidia gpu. This is because the nvidia installer part, it will blacklist nouveau. Hyprland will still be installed but it will skip blacklisting nouveau.
- NVIDIA users / owners, after installation, check [`THIS`](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Hyprland-Dots/wiki/Notes_to_remember#--for-nvidia-gpu-users)

#### 🔔 NOTICE TO ASUS ROG Laptop owners ### 
- There is an guide by Asusctl dev [`Asusctl`](https://asus-linux.org/wiki/opensuse-guide/)
- However. during my test, the ROG gui is not behaving well, and I cant click any button. So The asusctl and supergfxctl that I have set here are build from source through their gitlab

#### ✨ for ZSH and OH-MY-ZSH installation
> installer should auto change your default shell to zsh. However, if it does not, do this
```bash
chsh -s $(which zsh)
zsh
source ~/.zshrc
```
- reboot or logout
- by default `funky` theme is installed. You can find more themes from this [`OH-MY-ZSH-THEMES`](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes)
- to change the theme, `SUPER SHIFT O` , choose  desired theme, and close and open terminal. 
- or manually edit `~/.zshrc` . Look for ZSH_THEME="desired theme"

#### ✨ TO DO once installation done and dotfiles copied
- ~~if you opted to install gtk themes, to apply the theme and icon, press the dark/light button (beside the padlock). To apply Bibata modern ice cursor, launch nwg-look (GTK Settings) through rofi.~~ Hyprland-Dots v2.1.18, initial boot file will attempt to apply GTK themes,cursor, and icons. You can tweak more using nwg-look (GTK-Settings) utility

#### ✨ Packages that are manually downloaded and build. These packages will not be updated by dnf and have to be manually updated
- wallust [`LINK`](https://codeberg.org/explosion-mental/wallust)

#### ❗ some known issues for nvidia
- reports from members of my discord, states that some users of nvidia are getting stuck on sddm login. credit  to @Kenni Fix stated was 
```  
 while in sddm press ctrl+alt+F2 or F3
log into your account
`lspci -nn`, find the id of your nvidia card
`ls /dev/dri/by-path` find the matching id
`ls -l /dev/dri/by-path` to check where the symlink points to 
)
```
- add "env = WLR_DRM_DEVICES,/dev/dri/cardX" to the ENVvariables config `~/.config/hypr/UserConfigs/ENVariables.conf`  ; X being where the symlink of the gpu points to

- more info from the hyprland wiki [`Hyprland Wiki Link`](https://wiki.hyprland.org/FAQ/#my-external-monitor-is-blank--doesnt-render--receives-no-signal-laptop)


- reports from a member of discord for Nvidia for additional env's
- remove # from the following env's on 
```
env = GBM_BACKEND,nvidia-drm
env = WLR_RENDERER_ALLOW_SOFTWARE,1
```

#### ❗ other known issues
> [!NOTE]
> Auto start of Hyprland after login (no SDDM or GDM or any login managers)
- [ ] This was disabled a few days ago. (19 May 2024). This was because some users, after they used the Distro-Hyprland scripts with other DE (gnome-wayland or plasma-wayland), if they choose to login into gnome-wayland for example, Hyprland is starting. 
- [ ] to avoid this, I disabled it. You can re-enable again by editing `~/.zprofile` . Remove all the # on the first lines
- [ ] ROFI issues (scaling, unexplained scaling etc). This is most likely to experience if you are installing on a system where rofi is currently installed. To fix it uninstall rofi and install rofi-wayland . `sudo zypper rm rofi` . Install rofi-wayland with `sudo zypper in rofi-wayland`. Rofi-wayland is compatible with x11 so no need to worry.


#### 🔧 Proper way to re-installing a particular script from install-scripts directory
- CD into OpenSuse-Hyprland Folder and then ran the below command. 
- i.e. `./install-scripts/gtk-themes.sh` - For reinstall GTK Themes or
- `./install-scripts/sddm.sh` - For reinstall sddm
> [!IMPORTANT]
> DO NOT cd into install-scripts directory as script will most likely to fail

#### 🛣️ TO DO:
- ~~[ ] Install zsh and oh-my-zsh without necessary steps above~~ DONE 
- ~~[ ] Make it fully functional (duh 🤣)~~ done
- ~~[ ] hyprland-nvidia - NOT SUPPORTED~~ NOW SUPPORTED 🥳
- ~~[ ] SDDM is not starting. However, if you opt to install zsh, I have already set for auto log-in to Hyprland so once you set up zsh like the instruction above. You just need to type username and password.~~ FIXED 🥳
